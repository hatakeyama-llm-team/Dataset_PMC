input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,DiscussionThe data of the present study suggest that the role of the mirror neuron system in coding actions is more complex than previously shown and extends from action recognition to the coding of intentions.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Experiments in monkeys demonstrated that frontal and parietal mirror neurons code the “what” of the observed action (e.g., “the hand grasps the cup”) [4,6,8,34].",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"They did not address, however, the issue of whether these neurons, or a subset of them, also code the “why” of an action (e.g., “the hand grasps the cup in order to drink”).The findings of the present study showing increased activity of the right inferior frontal cortex for the Intention condition strongly suggest that this mirror neuron area actively participates in understanding the intentions behind the observed actions.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"If this area were only involved in action understanding (the “what” of an action), a similar response should have been observed in the inferior frontal cortex while observing grasping actions, regardless of whether a context surrounding the observed grasping action was present or not.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Before accepting this conclusion, however, there are some points that must be clarified.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"First, one might argue that the signal increase observed in the inferior frontal cortex was simply due to detecting an action in any context.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"That is, it is the complexity of observing an action embedded in a scene, and not the coding of the intention behind actions, that determined the signal increase.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"A second issue, closely related to the first one, is the issue of canonical neurons.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"These neurons fire at the sight of graspable objects. Because they are also located in the inferior frontal cortex, one might be led to conclude that the increased activity we observed in the Intention clips was due to the presence of objects.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Note, however, that canonical neurons do not fire at the sight of an action directed to a graspable object, even though the object is visible [35].A strong argument against both these objections is that the activity in inferior frontal cortex is reliably different between “drinking” Intention clips and “cleaning” Intention clips, even though graspable objects were present in both conditions.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In contrast, no differences in activity in the inferior frontal region were observed when “drinking” and “cleaning” clips of the Context condition were compared.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Thus, the simple presence of an action embedded in a scene is not sufficient to explain the findings.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Similarly, the sum of canonical and mirror neurons cannot account for the observed signal increase in the Intention condition, because this increase should be identical for both “drinking” and “cleaning.” Because “drinking” and “cleaning” contexts determined different activations in the Intention condition, it appears that there are sets of neurons in human inferior frontal cortex that specifically code the “why” of the action and respond differently to different intentions.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,An important issue to consider in interpreting these data is the relationship between the present results and the activity of single neurons in the activated area.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"On the basis of our current knowledge of physiological properties of the inferior frontal cortex, the most parsimonious explanation of the findings reported here is that mirror neurons are the likely neurons driving the signal changes in our study.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"This proposal needs, however, a clarification.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,The characteristic property of most mirror neurons is the congruence between their visual and motor properties.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,A neuron discharging during the execution of grasping also fires during observation of grasping done by another individual.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"This property cannot account for the present findings, specifically, the differences in response observed between the drinking and cleaning Intention clips.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,Our results suggest that a subset of mirror neurons in the inferior frontal cortex discharge in response to the motor acts that are most likely to follow the observed one.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In other words, in the Intention condition, there is activation of classical mirror neurons, plus activation of another set of neurons coding other potential actions sequentially related to the observed one.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"This interpretation of our findings implies that, in addition to the classically described mirror neurons that fire during the execution and observation of the same motor act (e.g., observed and executed grasping), there are neurons that are visually triggered by a given motor act (e.g., grasping observation), but discharge during the execution not of the same motor act, but of another act, functionally related to the observed act (e.g., bringing to the mouth).",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,Neurons of this type have indeed been previously reported in F5 and referred to as “logically related” neurons [34].,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In that previous study, however, the role of these “logically related” mirror neurons was never theoretically discussed and their functions remained unclear.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"The present findings not only allow one to attribute a functional role to these “logically related” mirror neurons, but also suggest that they may be part of a chain of neurons coding the intentions of other people's actions.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,What are the possible factors that selectively trigger these “logically related” mirror neurons?,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that the selection of these neurons is due to the observation of an action, also coded by classical mirror neurons, in a context in which that action is typically followed by a subsequent specific motor act.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In other words, observing an action carried out in a specific context recalls the chain of motor acts that typically is carried out in that context to actively achieve a goal.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Another possible explanation of how mirror neurons are triggered can be related not only to the context, but also to the way in which the action is performed.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"It is more common to grasp the handle of the cup with a precision grip while drinking, and to use a whole-hand prehension while cleaning up.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Thus, the grasp itself may convey information about the intention behind the grasping action.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Although this consideration is very plausible, in general, there are reasons to believe that it is unlikely that this mechanism played a role in our study.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"First, in all presented grasping actions, when the handle was on the same side of the approaching hand, the grasp was always a precision grip, but when the handle was on the opposite side of the approaching hand, the grasp was always a whole-hand prehension.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Thus, the hand always adopted the type of grasp afforded by the orientation of the cup, minimizing the impression that the type of grip would reflect the intentional state of the agent.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Second, this hypothesis cannot explain the empirical data.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In fact, in both drinking and cleaning Intention clips there was always the same number of precision grips and whole-hand prehensions.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"However, as Figure 4 shows, the drinking Intention entailed a much larger signal increase than the cleaning Intention.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Thus, the differential brain responses in the two Intention clips cannot be explained by a possible meaning conveyed by the grasp type, and cannot even be explained by a possible “compatibility effect” between grasp type and context type (for instance, a whole-hand prehension in a context suggesting cleaning).The stronger activation of the inferior frontal cortex in the “drinking” as compared to the “cleaning” Intention condition is consistent with our interpretation that a specific chain of neurons coding a probable sequence of motor acts underlies the coding of intention.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"There is no doubt that, of these two actions, drinking is not only more common and practiced, but also belongs to a more basic motor repertoire, while cleaning is culturally acquired.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"It is not surprising, therefore, that the chain of neurons coding the intention of drinking is more easily recruited and more widely represented in the inferior frontal cortex than the chain of neurons coding the intention of cleaning.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,The conventional view on intention understanding is that the description of an action and the interpretation of the reason why that action is executed rely on largely different mechanisms.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"In contrast, the present data show that the intentions behind the actions of others can be recognized by the motor system using a mirror mechanism.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"Mirror neurons are thought to recognize the actions of others, by matching the observed action onto its motor counterpart coded by the same neurons.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1044835.xml,"The present findings strongly suggest that coding the intention associated with the actions of others is based on the activation of a neuronal chain formed by mirror neurons coding the observed motor act and by “logically related” mirror neurons coding the motor acts that are most likely to follow the observed one, in a given context.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1043859.xml,"Indeed, experience-induced modifications of odour representations have been found at the level of the honeybee AL.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1043859.xml,"Thus, odour-evoked calcium signals in the AL can be modified by elemental [53] and nonelemental olfactory learning paradigms [35] such that the representations of odours that have to be discriminated become more distinct and uncorrelated as a result of learning.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1043859.xml,"In the fruit fly D. melanogaster, new glomeruli become active after olfactory learning [54], while in the moth M. sexta new neuronal units in the AL are recruited after olfactory learning [63].",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054884.xml,"It is indeed easy to show (detailed results not shown) that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally, analogous to single infections, while the remaining reproduces panmictically, negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054880.xml,"However, for highly correlated firing of pre- and postsynaptic cells, depending on the relative durations and amplitudes of the long-term potentiation and long-term depression temporal windows, more potentiation than depression may be triggered for connections going both ways [64,65].",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054881.xml,"When we compared Scc1 cleavage in cells expressing either wild-type or nonphosphorylatable SA2, we noticed that the levels of Scc1 cleavage products in the latter cells were only slightly increased, if at all (unpublished data).",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054881.xml,"The observation that some cohesin complexes do dissociate from chromosome arms even if Plk1 is depleted or if these complexes contain nonphosphorylatable SA2, whereas others do not, cannot simply be explained by slow dissociation kinetics of cohesin under these conditions, because those complexes that persist on chromosome arms can still be found there after 10 h of prometaphase arrest (see Figure 5B).",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054882.xml,The suppression of the mitotic arrest induced by Sgo1 depletion by Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc implies that it is the precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion and not the lack of some other function of Sgo1 that is largely responsible for the pathological mitotic arrest of Sgo1-depleted cells.,body

Nevertheless, our finding that 14% of Sgo1-depleted cells expressing SA2 12xA-myc had congression defects is consistent with the notion that Sgo1 might also function to regulate kinetochore-microtubule interactions.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054882.xml,"Second, the persistence of cyclin B1 throughout the period during which centromeric cohesion is lost in Sgo1-depleted cells implies that the APC/C is not activated and separase must therefore remain associated with its inhibitor chaperone securin.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054882.xml,"Third, cells expressing Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc proliferate fairly normally, and their timely destruction of sister chromatid cohesion at the onset of anaphase presumably involves the activation of separase by the APC/C. If separase deregulation were responsible for cohesin's precocious disappearance from centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells, then Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc would have to suppress this defect by delaying Scc1 cleavage, which is difficult to reconcile with the timely onset of anaphase in cells expressing Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1054882.xml,"It is therefore likely that Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin from different processes during mammalian mitosis and yeast meiosis, from chromosomal dissociation induced by Scc3-SA2 phosphorylation during mitosis, and from Rec8 or Scc1 cleavage during meiosis.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064084.xml,"Moreover, because up to 75% of breast cancer recurrences are detected by the patient and reported to the physician within a mean time of 1 month [27,28], we can reliably consider the observed recurrence timing as widely independent of the planned follow-up timing.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064084.xml,"The early sharp peak of the recurrence risk for pre-menopausal patients can be ascribed to a considerable switching of micro-metastatic foci to the angiogenic phenotype via the withdrawal of angiogenesis inhibitor(s) [10], and the sharpness of this peak supports the deterministic character of the triggering event.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064084.xml,"Other broader peaks may result from the induced proliferation of single cells through one or more growth-stimulating factors [9], resulting in successive avascular micrometastases, followed by the 'spontaneous' switching to the angiogenic phenotype, a process with stochastic characteristics, in keeping with peak shapes.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064084.xml,"As regards differences between pre-menopausal and post-menopausal patients, it should be taken into account that peculiar conditions relevant to breast cancer development, in particular conditions acting on angiogenetic traits, may be dependent on the host hormone milieu.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,"Other studies reporting an inability to detect the mutation [4,9,10] have applied no obvious selection criteria and it therefore seems unlikely that any selection bias is to blame for the lack of detectable mutation.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,The low level of risk of subsequent cancer attached to hyperplasia implies that many of these lesions fail to contribute to disease progression and it is perhaps therefore unsurprising that a mutation so far reported in only about one-third of hyperplasias by a single laboratory is found to be absent from more advanced lesions in the present study.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,"Preliminary reports of the K303R mutation in a higher proportion of breast cancers [2,3] from the same group as reported the original observations in hyperplasia are perplexing.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,The fact that Zhang and colleagues analysed 7 breast hyperplasias [4] and Tebbit and colleagues analysed 25 hyperplasias [9] and found no mutation rules out the use of hyperplasia as 'positive' controls and challenges the original observations.,body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,"This is probably suitable for use with microdissected lesions as used by Tebbit and colleagues for 36 invasive cancers, or lesions with a relatively high tumour content as used here (Table 1), but might not be sensitive enough for use with non-microdissected cancers used elsewhere [4,10] or if the mutation is present in only a small minority of cancer cells.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,We therefore also used gel-based PCR with restriction-fragment-length polymorphism and were able to detect as little as 1% mutant by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products from control mixing experiments.,body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,"However, in our experience, false positive mutations by DNA sequencing, as seen here in 16 of the 136 cancers tested, are to be expected when PCR reactions are performed on very low levels of DNA as found in many microdissected samples, or after digestion with restriction enzyme.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,It is therefore important to perform rigorous confirmatory assays.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,"To this end, we always sought to confirm mutations by sequencing in both directions to avoid anomalies that often occur as a result of the misincorporation of dideoxy terminators in unidirectional sequencing.",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,The fact that the mutation was always found in addition to the wild type is also to be expected with artefacts due to dideoxy terminator misincorporation.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064111.xml,The possibility that observations of the K303R mutation in hyperplasia result from a lack of specificity must therefore be considered and some doubt cast over other positive results in cancers.,body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,DiscussionThe winter period on the northern range of Yellowstone NP is shortening.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,Both late-winter SDTHs and the overall duration of snow cover have decreased significantly since 1948 (see Figures 1–3).,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,There are several potential causes of reduced snow pack.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Average TMIN and TMAX values are increasing in late winter, while midwinter snowfall appears to be declining (Table 1).",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,Compounding the effects of declining snowfalls on SDTH is an increase in the number of winter days with temperatures above freezing (see Figure 3C and 3D).Decreases in late-winter snow pack and in the date of last snow cover imply that elk will recover sooner from the detrimental stresses of winter: Smaller snow packs allow elk easier access to food and decrease energy expenditures required for movement.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"In addition, herbaceous plant growth usually begins within a few days to weeks of last snow cover [28], so elk may increase the quality and quantity of food intake earlier in the year, thus shortening the physiologically stressful winter period.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,These factors are likely to influence the timing and abundance of carrion as late-winter elk mortality declines.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"As we demonstrate here, climate change serves to sharply reduce the amount of late-winter carrion available to Yellowstone's scavengers (see Figure 4).",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"According to our statistical and dynamic models, however, this reduction is much less pronounced in the presence of wolves.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"In our statistical model, for instance, we found an 11% reduction with wolves versus a 66% reduction without wolves in April (see Figure 4).",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Our dynamic model, which incorporates wolf and elk population growth, also reveals a decline in late-winter carrion, especially in the absence of wolves (Figure 5).",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"In contrast to the statistical model, our dynamic model predicts an increase in early winter carrion, but less so with wolves.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"As the winter period shortens, elk that normally would die in March and April will increasingly die in the early winter months, November through February.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,This will lead to an increasingly pulsed or seasonal carrion resource.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,It is important to note that our model has more detailed elk than wolf dynamics.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"As suitable data become available, future work can attempt to tease out such factors as the effects of SDTH and territoriality on wolf kill-rate.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,In both our dynamic and statistical models we find that wolves buffer the effects of climate change on carrion abundance and timing.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,This effect will be crucial to scavenger species in the Yellowstone area that are highly dependent on winter and spring carrion for overwinter survival and reproduction.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Under scenarios without wolves, these species could face food bottlenecks in the absence of late-winter carrion.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,The magnitude of this effect will depend on how quickly these species adapt to a changing environment and how their other food resources respond to a shortening of the winter period.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Asynchrony of organismal responses to climate change has been prevalent in other areas, leading to changes in the competitive balance between species and to food shortages at important times of year [1].",body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"If late-winter carrion were to disappear without a corresponding change in the timing of elk calving or ground squirrel emergence, a serious food bottleneck could develop.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"As carrion becomes more concentrated over a shorter window of the year, the relative access to carrion among different scavenger species may change.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Highly aggregated or pulsed resources saturate local communities of scavengers, allowing species with better recruitment abilities (animals capable of covering large distances and communicating about the location of resources such as ravens and bald eagles) to dominate consumption at carcasses [17].",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Resources that are more dispersed, conversely, do not saturate local scavenger communities, so that a competitive dominance hierarchy (with grizzly bears and coyotes at the top) determines which species consume the bulk of available scavenge.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,Our analysis suggests that winter carrion in the absence of wolves will become increasingly pulsed during winter.,body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Consequently, areas without wolves may experience an increase in scavengers with high recruitment abilities.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,Actual numerical responses by scavenger species to wolf-provided carrion can now be tested in field studies by comparing areas with wolves to those without wolves in order to determine if changes in scavenger population sizes following wolf reintroduction are consistent with the predicted magnitude of the temporal subsidy due to wolves.,body

input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Late-winter carrion in Yellowstone will decline with or without wolves, but by buffering this reduction, wolves extend the timescale over which scavenger species can adapt to the changing environment.",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"It is important to note that under present-day climatic conditions, we expect wolves to decrease the long-term average elk population in Yellowstone [29].",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"This will lead to a corresponding decrease in average yearly carrion levels, which is expected to be small, however, because declines in carrion due to a drop in elk numbers will be partly offset by a higher turnover in the elk population due to wolf predation on old animals [29].",body
input/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1064850.xml,"Scenarios both with and without wolves therefore provide a meaningful and roughly equivalent (see Figure 4 in [29]) amount of carrion to scavengers.
